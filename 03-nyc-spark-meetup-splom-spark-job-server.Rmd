A model that:

1. Consumes raw market/indictive data
2. **Automatically** produces **numerical** and **visual** analyses that **business users** can leverage to make decisions

- Issued by BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited, authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.  Registered office: 12 Throgmorton Avenue, London, EC2N 2DL.  Tel: 020 7743 3000.  Registered in England No. 2020394.  For your protection telephone calls are usually recorded.  BlackRock is a trading name of BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited.
- Past performance is not a guide to future performance and should not be the sole factor of consideration when selecting a product. All financial investments involve an element of risk. Therefore, the value of your investment and the income from it will vary and your initial investment amount cannot be guaranteed.  Changes in the rates of exchange between currencies may cause the value of investments to go up and down.  Fluctuation may be particularly marked in the case of a higher volatility fund and the value of an investment may fall suddenly and substantially.  Levels and basis of taxation may change from time to time.
- Mandates we manage may be exposed to finance sector companies, as a service provider or as counterparty for financial contracts.  In recent months, liquidity in the financial markets has become severely restricted, causing a number of firms to withdrawn from the market, or in some extreme cases, becoming insolvent.  This may have an adverse affect on the mandates we manage.
