# Who are we? | BlackRock - "to create a better financial future for our clients"
# Who are our clients? | Institutional, retail, advisory, solutions

## How?
> - Aladdin - Software enabled business processes for running an asset manager
> - A culture of risk management - quantitatively measure/describe, simulate/forecast
> - Complex investments require similarly complex financial models to effectively risk manage
> - Complex financial models are data hungry beasts that need to be fed and groomed.

## How do we build financial models?
> - Data, data, data
> - Domain knowledge expressed in human directed feature selection
> - Visual representations of the data/model to create a feedback loop for the financial modeler
> - The Bionic Financial Modeler leverages technology to produce higher quality models
    - engineer for scale and straight-through processing
    - drive down the mean time per iteration
    - more iterations yield deeper understanding of the domain and higher quality financial models

## Why Spark?

### Why Scala?
* Functional programming allows for succinct expression of complex data processing tasks in composable ways
* Spark Scala programs do not incur substantial ceremony whilst delivering concurrency and parallelism

## Why Spark?

### Why Akka?
* Building stateful, scalable, composable, distributed systems is _really hard_ to do correctly
* Message passing + the Actors model of concurrent computation does a great job at hiding that complexity
* Functional reactive == high performance

## Why Spark?

### Spark helps us manage complexity and do so scalably
* We see Spark as a functional successor to Hadoop MR.
* The fundamental resilient distributed data structures are fostering a strong breadth of derived libraries and application integrations that are #awesome
** DataFrames and SQL, MLLib, Spark Streaming, SparkR

## Please...
- Make it fast and hide complexity/ceremony from me!
- Make it visual to stimulate my creativity!
- Make this experience a virtuous cycle of machine/human learning!
